# Predictive-engine-Insurance-company-marketing-efforts
Insurance	company	wants to	develop	a	tool	to	optimize	their
marketing	efforts.	They	have	given	us	a	data	set	as	a	result	of an	email	marketing	
campaign.	The	data	set	includes	customer	information, described	below,	as	a	well	as	
whether	the	customer	responded	to	the	marketing	campaign or	not.

**Task:**
Design	a	model	that	will	be	able	to	predict	whether	a	customer	will	respond	to	the	
marketing	campaign	based	on	his/her	information.	In	other	words,	predict	the	
‘responded’ target	variable	based	on	all	the	input	variables	
provided.

**Files:	
marketing_training.csv** - contains	the	training	set	that	you	will	use	to	build	the	
model.	The	target	variable is	‘responded’
**marketing_test.csv** – contains	testing	data	where	the	input	variables	are	provided	
but	not	the	‘responded’ target	column.

**Deliverables:**
<li>Two Workflows:
    <li> <b>Workflow 1</b>: Main Idea was to transform categorical variables into Indexed values for example (Categorical values under schooling (undergrad, high school etc.) have all been indexed.</li>
    <li><b>Workflow 2</b>:  I have used sampling and encoding techniques before training models, emphasis was more on transformation.</li>
